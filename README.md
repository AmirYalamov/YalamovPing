The Yalamov Ping is a small Ping CLI for MacOS and Linux. This project was done as a submission to the 2020 Cloudflare Internship Application: Systems challenge.

## Installation

Download the ```project.zip``` file and change directories into the project's directory. Type the following command into the terminal to install the args library:

```bash
sudo make install
```
After that, to build the project, simply type into the command terminal 

```bash
g++ ping.cpp -o ping
```

And you are good to go to use the Yalamov Ping!

## Features

This Ping CLI comes with a nice helpful ```OPTIONS``` menu that can be accessed by running the command ```sudo ./ping -h``` or ```sudo ./ping --help``` which shows all the available features:

## Using Ping
To use the ping utility, make sure that you have a working network connection by being connected to WiFi or by Ethernet cable. Then enter the command to run ping and either a hostname or IP address as an argument. For example, both commands are valid: 

```bash
sudo ./ping google.com
sudo ./ping 172.217.1.14
```
which will result in ping running until you hit "Control + C" on your keyboard to exit the ping utility:

### Features included:
In addition to Yalamov Ping showing you the Round Trip Time (RTT) and tracking lost packets, it also has:
- ```-t```: Time To Live (TTL): Allows you to set the time to live for an IP Address
- ```--ipv6```: IPv6 Support: Allows for IP version 6 support to allow for new IP addresses to be entered, accounting for the expanding need of new IP addresses and infrastructure to handle them
- ```-i```: Allows a user to set the interval time in seconds between sending each packet
- ```-p```: Allows a user to specify how many packets the want to send to the specified address

Ping can have example arguments as such:
- ```sudo ./ping -t 20 vw.com```
- ```sudo ./ping --ipv6 y 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:7879``` 
- ```sudo ./ping -t 50 -i 2 -p 3 lamborghini.com```
- ```sudo ./ping -i 3.14 reddit.com```
- ```sudo ./ping -p 2 news.ycombinator.com```
